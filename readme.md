# aws-sqs-sns-nodejs

### Dont forget to change the ARN parameters

- upload this code in whatever instance with policy to handle sqs. (cloud9 recommended)
- run the code, an sqs queue will be created.
- For SNS, create it from the AWS console and assign a subscriptio. (the SQS queue created before.)
- With both of them created, test inside the aws console or just running the code.
